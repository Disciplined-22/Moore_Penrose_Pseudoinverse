# This project enables prediction based on the established linear regression model

#### Please click on [Moore_Penrose_Pseudoinverse.ipynb](https://github.com/Disciplined-22/Moore_Penrose_Pseudoinverse/blob/main/Moore_Penrose_Pseudoinverse.ipynb) for more details and to access code through Google Colab.

#### Conclusion

Finally, the regression line is plotted using the obtained coefficients.

This method minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values, providing a best-fit line through the given data points.
